        <h1>Welcome to the exciting world of juggling!</h1>
        According to Webster's Dictionary, a juggler is one who performs tricks or acts of magic or deftness; one who is skilled in keeping objects in motion in the air at the same time by alternately tossing and catching them. Juggling goes back many hundreds of years. Egypt imported the art of juggling from India. There are frescos from ancient Egypt that show female jugglers. It has been an institution for many centuries in Iran, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Tibet. In the East, shamans and priests predicted the future, explored the unknown and diverted danger through juggling. Greeks and Romans and later Native Americans loved jugglers. Aztecs have made sculptures of people juggling using their hands and feet. In these early societies jugglers often participated in the religious and mythological rituals.
