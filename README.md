Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

My project is a site that contains various information about juggling. I learned how to juggle several years ago and thought it would be a fun site to make. I had a lot of fun changing the different style elements and incorporating Bootstrap in order to improve the appearance.

index.html is the welcome page that displays some history of juggling and why people might be interested in Juggling

second.html contains a list of the top 10 jugglers in the world and links to their bios on a juggling fan societies

third.html contains a list of common things that people juggle with and different instructional videos to learn how to juggle.

juggling.css contains the CSS styling for the different pages

Thanks!
